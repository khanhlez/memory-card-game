# Memory Card Game

A memory card game with FC24 players using JavaScript and React.

Your goal is to select as many characters as possible without clicking on the same one twice. Your score is incremented by 1 each time you successfully pick a card you hadn't selected yet and it is reset to 0 when you select the same card twice.
